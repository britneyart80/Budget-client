## Introduction

My project, 'Dollary', is here to provide a platform for logging your spendings each month and keeping track of your budget and how much you've spent so far. User's are able to create an account, create envelopes (which contain your spendings for that month) and add spendings into each envelope to keep budgeting organized.

This project is still in progress and I plan to continue expanding the number of features available!

## Development Process

I started off this project with wireframes and user stories, mapping out how I wanted the application to look and what features I wanted the user to have. Since this project required building our own API, I started on that first, setting up the databases and tables I would need for all my entity relationships.
For the front-end, I decided to finish all functionality first without any styling. This made it very easy to navigate the page during the development because everything is on the page and there are no hidden elements yet. I found this to be extremely efficient as when styling is done first, you will need to renavigate to the part you were working on every time you refresh the page.

## Problem Solving Strategy

When I encountered problems, I made sure to read error messages extremely carefully. Since this is my first project with my own back-end, errors could be coming from both ends instead of just the front, so I had to make sure I was looking for bugs in the right area. Once I found the source, I found that console.logs were my best friend. They helped me to figure out whether data was being transferred properly, and if not, I could take steps back to slowly locate the bug.

## Additions/Problems

If I were to further this project, I would love to give users the option to add their own categories. It would be a really cool feature as well if users had the option to see an overview of their spendings from each month. I would also love to add in a feature which allows a user to see their spendings based on category
